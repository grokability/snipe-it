        Please complete the following steps using the available tools:

        1. List assets (filtered by the scope above if provided) and tally counts by status: Deployed, Ready to Deploy, Archived, Pending, Out for Repair.
        2. Break the deployed count down by asset category (laptops, monitors, phones, etc.).
        3. List the top 5 models by total quantity.
        4. Show total purchase value of the inventory if cost data is available.
        5. Highlight any categories with zero available (Ready to Deploy) assets — potential stock-out risk.
        6. Present the results as a concise executive summary with a supporting breakdown table.

        return Response::text(trim($prompt).$this->localeInstruction());
